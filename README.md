## TDD for Infrastructure code with Molecule!

[Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) seems to be a pretty neat TDD framework for testing Infrastructur-as-Code using Ansible. As previously announced on September 26 2018 [Ansible treats Molecule as a first class citizen](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ansible-project/ehrb6AEptzA) from now on - backed by Redhat also.

Molecule executes the following steps:

![tdd-for-iac](https://yuml.me/diagram/scruffy/class/[Given:%20Spin%20up%20Infrastructure%20with%20Docker%20or%20Vagrant%20or%20Other]-&gt;[When:%20Execute%20Ansible%20Playbooks/Roles],[When:%20Execute%20Ansible%20Playbooks/Roles]-&gt;[Then:%20Assert%20with%20Testinfra],[Then:%20Assert%20with%20Testinfra]-&gt;[Cleanup%20Infrastructure])

In the `Then` phase Molecule executes different [Verifiers](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#verifier), one of them is [Testinfra](https://testinfra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), where you can write Unittest with a Python DSL. 

> Beware of old links to v1 of Molecule! As I followed blog posts that were just from a year or two ago, I walked into the trap of using Molecule v1. This is especially problematic if you try to install Molecule via `homebrew` where you currently also get the v1 version. So always double check, if there´s no `/v1/` in the docs´ url:

![current-docs-url](screenshots/current-docs-url.png)

Just start here: [Molecule docs](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html)


## Prerequisites

* `brew cask install virtualbox`
* `brew cask install vagrant`

> Please don´t install Ansible and Molecule with homebrew on Mac, but always with pip3 since you only get old versions and need to manually install testinfra, ansible, flake8 and other packages

And as we learned with [pulumi-python-aws-ansible](https://github.com/jonashackt/pulumi-python-aws-ansible) and escpecially in [Replace direct usage of virtualenv and pip with pipenv](https://github.com/jonashackt/pulumi-python-aws-ansible#replace-direct-usage-of-virtualenv-and-pip-with-pipenv), we should use a great Python dependency management tool like [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) instead of no or non-pinned (`requirements.txt`) dependencies.

Therefore let's install `pipenv`:

```
pip3 install pipenv
``` 

Then create a virtual environment for the current project (pinned to Python 3.7+):

```
pipenv shell --python 3.7
```

And finally install needed pip packages with:

```
pipenv install ansible molecule
```

> For using Vagrant with Molecule we also need `python-vagrant` module installed
* `pipenv install python-vagrant`



## Project structure

To initialize a new Molecule powered Ansible role named `docker` with the Vagrant driver and the Testinfra verifier you have to execute the following command:

`molecule init role --driver-name vagrant --verifier-name testinfra docker`

This will give:

`--> Initializing role docker...
 Successfully initialized new role in /Users/jonashecht/dev/molecule-ansible-vagrant/docker.`

Molecule introduces a well known project structure (at least for a Java developer like me):

![projectstructure](screenshots/projectstructure.png)

As you may notice the role standard directory `tasks` is now accompanied by a `tests` directory inside the `molecule` folder where the Testinfra testcases reside.

This repository uses [a Ansible role](tasks/main.yml) that installs Docker into an Ubuntu Box:

```yaml
- name: add Docker apt key
  apt_key:
    url: https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg
    id: 9DC858229FC7DD38854AE2D88D81803C0EBFCD88
    state: present
  ignore_errors: true

- name: add docker apt repo
  apt_repository:
    repo: "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu {{ ansible_lsb.codename }} stable"
    update_cache: yes
  become: true

- name: install Docker apt package
  apt:
    pkg: docker-ce
    state: latest
    update_cache: yes
  become: true

- name: add vagrant user to docker group.
  user:
    name: vagrant
    groups: docker
    append: yes
  become: true
```

With Testinfra we can assert on things we want to achieve with our Ansible role: Install the `docker` package and add the user `vagrant` to the group `docker`. Testinfra uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/example/index.html) to execute the tests. Our testcases could be found in [test_docker.py](molecule/tests/test_docker.py):

```python
import testinfra.utils.ansible_runner

testinfra_hosts = testinfra.utils.ansible_runner.AnsibleRunner(
    '.molecule/ansible_inventory').get_hosts('all')


def test_is_docker_installed(host):
    package_docker = host.package('docker-ce')

    assert package_docker.is_installed


def test_vagrant_user_is_part_of_group_docker(host):
    user_vagrant = host.user('vagrant')

    assert 'docker' in user_vagrant.groups
    
```

## Molecule configuration

The [molecule.yml](molecule/vagrant-ubuntu/molecule.yml) configures Molecule:

```
scenario:
  name: vagrant-ubuntu

driver:
  name: vagrant
  provider:
    name: virtualbox
platforms:
  - name: vagrant-ubuntu
    box: ubuntu/bionic64
    memory: 512
    cpus: 1
    provider_raw_config_args:
    - "customize [ 'modifyvm', :id, '--uartmode1', 'disconnected' ]"

provisioner:
  name: ansible
  lint:
    name: ansible-lint
    enabled: false
  playbooks:
    converge: playbook.yml

lint:
  name: yamllint
  enabled: false
verifier:
  name: testinfra
  directory: ../tests/
  env:
    # get rid of the DeprecationWarning messages of third-party libs,
    # see https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/warnings.html#deprecationwarning-and-pendingdeprecationwarning
    PYTHONWARNINGS: "ignore:.*U.*mode is deprecated:DeprecationWarning"
  lint:
    name: flake8
  options:
    # show which tests where executed in test output
    v: 1

```

We have some specialties here. First thing is the follow addition to the `platforms` key:

```
    provider_raw_config_args:
    - "customize [ 'modifyvm', :id, '--uartmode1', 'disconnected' ]"
```

Without this configuration Molecule isn´t able to spin up "standard" Vagrant Ubuntu boxes like `ubuntu/bionic64` and `ubuntu/xenial64`. If you do a `tail -f /var/folders/5p/l1cc1kqd69n_qxrftgln7xdm0000gn/T/molecule/docker/default/vagrant-ubuntu-docker.err`, you see errors like this:

```
There was an error while executing `VBoxManage`, a CLI used by Vagrant
for controlling VirtualBox. The command and stderr is shown below.

Command: ["startvm", "64c5ca1e-0f7c-4dea-bc07-8144a56a0029", "--type", "headless"]

Stderr: VBoxManage: error: RawFile#0 failed to create the raw output file /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/molecule/provisioner/ansible/playbooks/vagrant/ubuntu-bionic-18.04-cloudimg-console.log (VERR_ACCESS_DENIED)
```

This is a workaround until https://github.com/ansible/molecule/issues/1556 gets fixed. This shouldn´t be necessary to be configured.

The second thing is `PYTHONWARNINGS: "ignore:.*U.*mode is deprecated:DeprecationWarning"` environment variable definition. If you don´t configure this you´ll end up with bloated test logs like this:

![verify-with-deprecation-warnings](screenshots/verify-with-deprecation-warnings.png)

If you use the `PYTHONWARNINGS` environment variable you gather beautiful and __green__ test executions:

![verify-with-deprecation-warnings-ignored](screenshots/verify-with-deprecation-warnings-ignored.png)


In case everything runs green you may notice that there´s is no hint which tests were executed. But I think that´s rather a pity since we want to see our whole test suite executed. That was the whole point why we even started to use a testing framework like Molecule!

But luckily there´s a way to get those tests shown inside our output. As Molecule uses [Testinfra](https://testinfra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/invocation.html) which itself leverages [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) to execute our test cases and Testinfra is able to invoke pytest with additional properties. And pytest has [many options we can experiment with](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html#configuration-options). To configure a more verbose output for our tests in Molecule, add the following to the `verifier` section of your `molecule.yml`:

```
verifier:
  name: testinfra
...
  options:
    # show which tests where executed in test output
    v: 1
...
```

If we now execute a `molecule verify` we should see a much nicer overview of which test cases where executed:

![verify-with-pytest-verbose](screenshots/verify-with-pytest-verbose.png)


## Execute Molecule
 
Now we´re able to run our first test. Go into `docker` directory and run:

`molecule test`

As Molecule has different phases, you can also explicitely run `molecule converge` or `molecule verify` - the commands will recognice required upstream phases like `create` and skips them if they where already run before (e.g. if the Vagrant Box is running already).



# Multi-Scenario Molecule setup

With Molecule we could not only test our Ansible roles against one infrastructure setup - but we can use multiple of them! We only need to leverage the power of [Molecule scenarios](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#scenario).

To get an idea on how this works I sligthly restructured the repository. We started out with the Vagrant driver / scenario. Now after also implementing a Docker driver in this repository on it´s own: https://github.com/jonashackt/molecule-ansible-docker I integrated it into this repository.

And because Docker is the default Molecule driver for testing Ansible roles I changed the name of the Vagrant scenario to `vagrant-ubuntu`. Don´t forget to install `docker`:

```
pip3 install docker
```

Using `molecule test` as we´re used to will now execute the Docker (e.g. `default`) scenario. This change results in the following project structure:

![multi-scenario-projectstructure](screenshots/multi-scenario-projectstructure.png)

To execute the `vagrant-ubuntu` Scenario you have to explicitely call it´s name:

```
molecule test --scenario-name vagrant-ubuntu
```

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/213352.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/213352)

All the files which belong only to a certain scenario are placed inside the scenarios directory. For example in the Docker scenario this is `Dockerfile.js` and in Vagrant one this is `prepare.yml`. Also the `molecule.yml` files have to access the `playbook.yml` and the testfiles differently since they are now separate from the scenario directory to be [able to reuse them over all scenarios](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html#sharing-across-scenarios):

```
...
provisioner:
  name: ansible
...
  playbooks:
    converge: ../playbook.yml
...
verifier:
  name: testinfra
  directory: ../tests/
...
```

Now we can also integrate & use TravisCI in this repository since the [default scenario Docker is supported on Travis](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/testing.html#travis-ci)! :)

![travisci-molecule-executing-testinfra-tests](screenshots/travisci-molecule-executing-testinfra-tests.png)



## Ubuntu based Docker-in-Docker builds

As we don´t have a Vagrant environment in a Cloud CI system available for us right now (see https://github.com/jonashackt/vagrant-ansible-on-appveyor), we should be enable us somehow to test our Ansible role only with the Docker driver.

The standard Docker-in-Docker image provided by Docker Inc is based on Alpine Linux (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/53459483/4964553 & the `dind` tags in https://hub.docker.com/_/docker/). But our role is designed for Ubuntu and thus uses the `apt` package manager instead of `apk`. So we can´t use the standard Docker-in-Docker image.

But there should be a way to do Docker-in-Docker installation with a Ubuntu base image like `ubuntu:bionic`! And there is :) 

Let´s assume the [standard Ubuntu Docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce-1) our starting point. Everything described there is done inside our Ansible role under test __docker__ inside the playbook [docker/tasks/main.yml](tasks/main.yml).

All the extra steps needed to install Docker inside a Ubuntu Docker container will be handled inside the `prepare` step. Therefore we´ll use [Molecules´ prepare.yml playbook](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#id12):

> The prepare playbook executes actions which bring the system to a given state prior to converge. It is executed after create, and only once for the duration of the instances life. This can be used to bring instances into a particular state, prior to testing.


### Configure a custom prepare step
 
The Docker-in-Docker build is only used ([and should only be used](https://jpetazzo.github.io/2015/09/03/do-not-use-docker-in-docker-for-ci/)) inside our CI pipeline. The `prepare` step inside our Molecule test suites´s `default` Docker scenario will be only executed for testing purposes.
 
So let´s configure our `default` Docker scenario to use a `prepare.yml` which could be done inside the `molecule.yml`:

```yaml
...
  playbooks:
    prepare: prepare-docker-in-docker.yml
    converge: ../playbook.yml
...
```


### Docker-in-Docker with ubuntu:bionic

Now we should have a look into the [prepare-docker-in-docker.yml](molecule/prepare-docker-in-docker.yml):

```yaml
# Prepare things only necessary in Ubuntu Docker-in-Docker scenario
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    # We need to anticipate the installation of Docker before the role execution...
  - name: use our role to install Docker
    include_tasks: ../../tasks/main.yml

  - name: create /etc/docker
    file:
      state: directory
      path: /etc/docker

  - name: set storage-driver to vfs via daemon.json
    copy:
      content: |
        {
          "storage-driver": "vfs"
        }
      dest: /etc/docker/daemon.json

  # ...since we need to start Docker in a complete different way
  - name: start Docker daemon inside container see https://stackoverflow.com/a/43088716/4964553
    shell: "/usr/bin/dockerd -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock > dockerd.log 2>&1 &"
```

First the Docker installation has to be executed just in the same way as on a virtual machine using Vagrant. So we simply re-use the existing Docker role here - so we´re not forced to copy code!

Then really being able to run Docker-in-Docker we need to do three things:

1. Run Docker with `--priviledged` (which should really only be used inside our CI environment, because it grant´s full access to the host environment (see https://hub.docker.com/_/docker/))
2. Use the [storage-driver `vfs`](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/vfs-driver/#configure-docker-with-the-vfs-storage-driver), which is slow & inefficient but is the only one guaranteed to work regardless of underlying filesystems
3. Start the Docker daemon with `/usr/bin/dockerd -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock > dockerd.log 2>&1 &`, or otherwise you´ll run into errors like `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?` (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/43088716/4964553)

You may noticed that __2.__ & __3.__ are handled by our `prepare-docker-in-docker.yml` already. To enable the __1.__ `--priviledged` mode we need to configure Molecules´ Docker driver inside the `molecule.yml`:

```yaml
...
driver:
  name: docker
platforms:
  - name: docker-ubuntu
    image: ubuntu:bionic
    privileged: true
...
```

### Testing the Docker-in-Docker installation

The last step - or the first, if you leverage the power of Test-Driven-Development (TDD) - was to create a suitable testcase. This test should verify whether the Docker-in-Docker installation was successful.

Therefore we can use the [hello-world](https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world/) Docker image. Let´s execute a `docker run hello-world` straight inside our test case `test_run_hello_world_container_successfully` in our test suite [test_docker.py](molecule/tests/test_docker.py):

```
def test_run_hello_world_container_successfully(host):
    hello_world_ran = host.run("docker run hello-world")

    assert 'Hello from Docker!' in hello_world_ran.stdout
```

This will verify that

1. the Docker client is able to contact the Docker daemon
2. the Docker daemon successfully pulled the image `hello-world` from the Docker Hub
3. the Docker daemon created a new container from that image and runs the executable inside
4. the Docker daemon streamed the executables output containing `Hello from Docker!` to the Docker client, which send it to the terminal


# Molecule with AWS EC2 as the infrastructure provider

Now that we successfully used Vagrant & Docker as infrastructure providers for Molecule, we should now start to use a cloud provider like AWS. 

We should be able to use [Molecule's EC2 driver](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#ec2), which itself uses [Ansible's ec2 module](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/ec2_module.html) to interact with AWS.

First we need to install the [Boto Python packages](https://pypi.org/project/boto/). They will provide interfaces to Amazon Web Services:

```
pip3 install boto boto3
```


### Configure Molecule to use EC2

Then we just init a new Molecule scenario inside our existing multi scenario project called `aws-ec2-ubuntu`. Therefore we can leverage Molecule's `molecule init scenario` command:

```
cd molecule-ansible-docker-vagrant/docker

molecule init scenario --driver-name ec2 --role-name docker --scenario-name aws-ec2-ubuntu
```

That should create a new directory `aws-ec2-ubuntu` inside the `docker/molecule` folder.  We'll integrate the results into our multi scenario project in a second.

Now let's dig into the generated `molecule.yml`:

```yaml
scenario:
  name: aws-ec2-ubuntu

driver:
  name: ec2
platforms:
  - name: instance
    image: ami-a5b196c0
    instance_type: t2.micro
    vpc_subnet_id: subnet-6456fd1f

provisioner:
  name: ansible
  lint:
    name: ansible-lint
    enabled: false
  playbooks:
    converge: ../playbook.yml

lint:
  name: yamllint
  enabled: false

verifier:
  name: testinfra
  directory: ../tests/
  env:
    # get rid of the DeprecationWarning messages of third-party libs,
    # see https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/warnings.html#deprecationwarning-and-pendingdeprecationwarning
    PYTHONWARNINGS: "ignore:.*U.*mode is deprecated:DeprecationWarning"
  lint:
    name: flake8
  options:
    # show which tests where executed in test output
    v: 1
```

As we already tuned the `molecule.yml` files for our other scenarios like `docker` and `vagrant-ubuntu`, we know what to change here. `provisioner.playbook.converge` needs to be configured, so the one `playbook.yml` could be found.

Also the `verifier` section has to be enhanced to gain all the described advantages like supressed deprecation warnings and the better test result overview.

As you may noticed, the driver now uses `ec2` and the platform is already pre-configured with a concrete Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and `instance_type` etc. I just tuned the instance name to `aws-ec2-ubuntu`, like we did in our Docker and Vagrant scenarios.


### Having a look into the create.yml

The generated `create.yml` and `destroy.yml` Ansible playbooks look rather stunning - especially to AWS newbees. Let's have a look into the `create.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Create
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: false
  no_log: "{{ not (lookup('env', 'MOLECULE_DEBUG') | bool or molecule_yml.provisioner.log|default(false) | bool) }}"
  vars:
    ssh_user: ubuntu
    ssh_port: 22

    security_group_name: molecule
    security_group_description: Security group for testing Molecule
    security_group_rules:
      - proto: tcp
        from_port: "{{ ssh_port }}"
        to_port: "{{ ssh_port }}"
        cidr_ip: '0.0.0.0/0'
      - proto: icmp
        from_port: 8
        to_port: -1
        cidr_ip: '0.0.0.0/0'
    security_group_rules_egress:
      - proto: -1
        from_port: 0
        to_port: 0
        cidr_ip: '0.0.0.0/0'

    keypair_name: molecule_key
    keypair_path: "{{ lookup('env', 'MOLECULE_EPHEMERAL_DIRECTORY') }}/ssh_key"
  tasks:
    - name: Create security group
      ec2_group:
        name: "{{ security_group_name }}"
        description: "{{ security_group_name }}"
        rules: "{{ security_group_rules }}"
        rules_egress: "{{ security_group_rules_egress }}"

    - name: Test for presence of local keypair
      stat:
        path: "{{ keypair_path }}"
      register: keypair_local

    - name: Delete remote keypair
      ec2_key:
        name: "{{ keypair_name }}"
        state: absent
      when: not keypair_local.stat.exists

    - name: Create keypair
      ec2_key:

``` 

If we skim over the code, we notice the usage of Ansible's [ec2_group module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/ec2_group_module.html). It is used to maintains AWS EC2 security groups. Using the parameters `rules` and `rules_egress`, it configures appropriate firewall inbound and outbound rules.

Thereafter Ansible's [ec2_key module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/ec2_key_module.html) is used to create a new EC2 key pair & store it locally, if non exists on your local machine already.

And then the [ec2 module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/ec2_module.html) takes over, which is able to create or terminate AWS EC2 instances without the need to hassle with the GUI.

Waiting for the EC2 instance to come up, the `create.yml` playbook uses the [async_status module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/async_status_module.html) on the pre-registered variable `server.results` from the `ec2` module.

The following Ansible module are solely used to create an inline Ansible inventory, which is finally used to connect into the EC2 instance via SSH.

The generated `destroy.yml` playbook is just the opposite to the `create.yml` playbook and tears the created EC2 instance down.


### Install & configure AWS CLI

Now let's give our configuration a shot. Just be sure to meet some prerequisites. 

First we need to sure to have the [AWS CLI installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html). We can also do this via pip package manager with:
 
```
pipenv install awscli
```
 
Now we should check, if AWS CLI was successfully installed. The `aws --version` command should print out sometime like:

```
$ aws --version
aws-cli/1.16.80 Python/3.7.2 Darwin/18.2.0 botocore/1.12.70
```

Now configure the AWS CLI to use the correct credentials. [According to the AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html#cli-quick-configuration), the fastest way to accomplish that is to run `aws configure`:

```
$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
Default region name [None]: eu-central-1
Default output format [None]: json
```

### Configure Region & VPC subnet id 

As there currently is a discrepancy in the UX of Molecule, where every configuration parameter is generated correctly by a `molecule init --driver-name ec2` command and picked up from `~/.aws/credentials`. __Except__ the `region` configuration from `~/.aws/config`!

Running a Molecule test without setting the region correctly as environment variable, currently results [in the (already documented) error](https://github.com/ansible/molecule/issues/1570):

```
"msg": "Either region or ec2_url must be specified",
```

So for now we need to set the region manually before running our Molecule tests against EC2:

```
export EC2_REGION=eu-central-1
```

And there's another thing to do: We need to configure the correct `vpc_subnet_id` inside our `molecule.yml` - if not, we get an error like this:

```
    "    raise self.ResponseError(response.status, response.reason, body)",
    "boto.exception.EC2ResponseError: EC2ResponseError: 400 Bad Request",
    "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>",
    "<Response><Errors><Error><Code>InvalidSubnetID.NotFound</Code><Message>The subnet ID 'subnet-6456fd1f' does not exist</Message></Error></Errors><RequestID>1c971ba2-0d86-4335-9445-d989e988afce</RequestID></Response>"
]
```

We need to somehow figure out the correct VPC subnet id of our region. Therefore, you can simply use Ansible to gather that for you by using the [ec2_vpc_subnet_facts module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/ec2_vpc_subnet_facts_module.html):

```
    - name: Gather facts about all VPC subnets
      ec2_vpc_subnet_facts:
```

This will give the correct String inside the field `subnets.id`:

```
    ok: [localhost] => {
        "changed": false,
        "invocation": {
            "module_args": {
                "aws_access_key": null,
                ...
            }
        },
        "subnets": [
            {
                "assign_ipv6_address_on_creation": false,
                "availability_zone": "eu-central-1b",
                "availability_zone_id": "euc1-az3",
                ...
                "id": "subnet-a2efa1d9",
                ...
            },

```

As an alternative you can use AWS CLI with `aws ec2 describe-subnets` to find the correct ID inside the field `Subnets.SubnetId`:

```
$ aws ec2 describe-subnets

{
    "Subnets": [
        {
            "AvailabilityZone": "eu-central-1b",
            "AvailabilityZoneId": "euc1-az3",
            ...
            "SubnetId": "subnet-a2efa1d9",
            ...
        },
        {
            "AvailabilityZone": "eu-central-1c",
            ...
        },
        {
            "AvailabilityZone": "eu-central-1a",
            ...
        }
    ]
}
```

Now head over to your [molecule.yml](molecule/aws-ec2-ubuntu/molecule.yml) and edit the `vpc_subnet_id` to contain the correct value:

```
scenario:
  name: aws-ec2-ubuntu

driver:
  name: ec2
platforms:
  - name: aws-ec2-ubuntu
    image: ami-a5b196c0
    instance_type: t2.micro
    vpc_subnet_id: subnet-a2efa1d9
...
```


### Choosing an Ubuntu 18.04 AMI

[As stated here[(https://askubuntu.com/a/1031156/451114), Amazon has a "official" Ubuntu 18.04 AMI - but this one isn't available under the free tier right now. 

But the official image is just the same as from Canonical, which could be found with the [ubuntu Amazon EC2 AMI Locator](https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/):

Fill in your region - e.g. for me this is `eu-central-1` - together with the desired Ubuntu version - like `18.04 LTS` - and the site should filter all available AMI images in this region:

![ubuntu-Amazon-EC2-AMI-Locator](screenshots/ubuntu-Amazon-EC2-AMI-Locator.png)

Now choose the AMI id with the __Instance Type__ `hvm:ebs-ssd`, which means that our EC2 instance will use Amazon Elastic Block Storage memory. Only this instance type is eligible for the free tier. In our region the the correct AMI id for Ubuntu 18.04 is `ami-080d06f90eb293a27`. We need to configure this inside our [molecule.yml](molecule/aws-ec2-ubuntu/molecule.yml):

```
scenario:
  name: aws-ec2-ubuntu

driver:
  name: ec2
platforms:
  - name: aws-ec2-ubuntu
    image: ami-080d06f90eb293a27
    instance_type: t2.micro
    vpc_subnet_id: subnet-a2efa1d9
...
```


### Creating a EC2 instance with Molecule


Now we should have everything prepared. Let's try to run our first Molecule test on AWS EC2 (including `--debug` so that we see what's going on):

```
molecule --debug create --scenario-name aws-ec2-ubuntu
```

We could have a sneak peak into our Ansible EC2 Management console under https://eu-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=eu-central-1. We should see our EC2 instance starting up:

![aws-ec2-management-console-instance-startup](screenshots/aws-ec2-management-console-instance-startup.png)

If everything went fine, the `molecule create` command should succeed and your EC2 console should show the running EC2 instance:

![aws-ec2-management-console-instance-running](screenshots/aws-ec2-management-console-instance-running.png)



### Run a first Test on EC2 with Molecule

Now let's try to run our Ansible role against our new EC2 instance with Molecule:

```
molecule converge --scenario-name aws-ec2-ubuntu
```

That should just work fine. We then could head over to the verify-phase:

```
molecule verify --scenario-name aws-ec2-ubuntu
```

This should successfully execute our Testinfra test suite described in [test_docker.py](molecule/tests/test_docker.py) onto our EC2 instance. If everything ran fine, it should give something like:

![aws-molecule-verify-success](screenshots/aws-molecule-verify-success.png)

If the last test function fails with an error like:
```
docker: Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock
```
you maybe have to add `sudo ` to the `docker run hello-world` statement:

```
def test_run_hello_world_container_successfully(host):
    hello_world_ran = host.run("sudo docker run hello-world")

    assert 'Hello from Docker!' in hello_world_ran.stdout
```


### Cleaning up

Finally it's time to clean up. Let's run a `molecule destroy` command to tear down or EC2 instance:

```
molecule --debug destroy --scenario-name aws-ec2-ubuntu
```

If that command went well, we can have a look into our AWS EC2 management console again:

![aws-ec2-management-console-instance-terminated](screenshots/aws-ec2-management-console-instance-terminated.png)

Our instance should have reached the state `terminated`, which is simmilar to `stopped` state - just for instances that used EBS storage (see the [AWS EC2 Instance Lifecycle chart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html) for more info).

Here's a full asciinema cast of all the steps:

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/220434.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/220434)


### Final check: molecule test

As you may remember, Molecule provides the consecutive list of steps that run one by one. For introductory reasons we choosed to execute each step manually.

But having everything configured and in place right now, we should be able to run the command that summarizes all the others: `molecule test`:

```
molecule test --scenario-name aws-ec2-ubuntu
```


## Use TravisCI to execute Molecule with EC2 infrastructure

My ultimate goal of the whole Molecule journey was to be able to let TravisCI create Cloud environments and execute Ansible roles on them.

So we should bring all the things learned togehter now: 

> Using Molecule to develop and test an Ansible role - togehter with the infrastructure provider AWS EC2 - automatically executed by TravisCI after commits or regularly with TravisCI cron jobs.

So let's do it! First we need to configure TravisCI. Therefore we need to enhance our [.travis.yml](.travis.yml). As we need the same python package additions as locally, we need to install `boto`, `boto3` and `awscli`:

```yaml
sudo: required
language: python

env:
- EC2_REGION=eu-central-1

services:
- docker

install:
- pip install molecule docker

# install AWS related packages
- pip install boto boto3
- pip install --upgrade awscli
# configure AWS CLI
- aws configure set aws_access_key_id $AWS_ACCESS_KEY
- aws configure set aws_secret_access_key $AWS_SECRET_KEY
- aws configure set default.region $DEPLOYMENT_REGION
# show AWS CLI config
- aws configure list

script:
# Molecule Testing Travis-locally with Docker
- molecule test
# Molecule Testing on AWS EC2
- molecule create --scenario-name aws-ec2-ubuntu
- molecule converge --scenario-name aws-ec2-ubuntu
- molecule verify --scenario-name aws-ec2-ubuntu
- molecule destroy --scenario-name aws-ec2-ubuntu
```

After that, we need to configure our AWS CLI to use the correct credentials and AWS region. This can be achieved by usind the `aws configure set` command. Then we need to head over to the settings tab of our TravisCI project (for the current project this can be found at https://travis-ci.org/jonashackt/molecule-ansible-docker-vagrant/settings) and insert the three environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SECRET_KEY` and `DEPLOYMENT_REGION`:

![travisci-aws-settings-env-variables](screenshots/travisci-aws-settings-env-variables.png)

The last part is to add the molecule commands to the `script` section of the `.travis.yml`. 


### Problems with boto on Travis

As https://github.com/boto/boto/issues/3717 suggests, there are currently problems with the AWS connection library boto on TravisCI. They result in errors like:

```
        "msg": "Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/travis/.ansible/tmp/ansible-tmp-1547040777.3-69673074739502/async_wrapper.py\", line 147, in _run_module\n    (filtered_outdata, json_warnings) = _filter_non_json_lines(outdata)\n  File \"/home/travis/.ansible/tmp/ansible-tmp-1547040777.3-69673074739502/async_wrapper.py\", line 88, in _filter_non_json_lines\n    raise ValueError('No start of json char found')\nValueError: No start of json char found\n",

            "AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'plugin'"
        ]
    }
    
    PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
    localhost                  : ok=6    changed=4    unreachable=0    failed=1   
    
    
ERROR: 
The command "molecule --debug create --scenario-name aws-ec2-ubuntu" exited with 2.
```

To fix this, there are two changes needed inside our [.travis.yml](.travis.yml). We need to set `sudo: false` and use the environment variable `BOTO_CONFIG=/dev/null`: 

```yaml
sudo: false
language: python

env:
- EC2_REGION=eu-central-1 BOTO_CONFIG="/dev/null"
...
```

And we need to add the `BOTO_CONFIG` environment variable to the same line as the already existing variable - otherwise Travis starts multiple builds with only one variable set to each build! See the docs (https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#defining-multiple-variables-per-item)

> If you need to specify several environment variables for each build, put them all on the same line in the env array

Now head over to Travis and have a look into the log. It should look green and somehow like this: https://travis-ci.org/jonashackt/molecule-ansible-docker-vagrant/builds/477365844

### Use pipenv with TravisCI

As described in [Replace direct usage of virtualenv and pip with pipenv](https://github.com/jonashackt/pulumi-python-aws-ansible#replace-direct-usage-of-virtualenv-and-pip-with-pipenv), we use the great Python dependency management tool like [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) instead of no or non-pinned (`requirements.txt`) dependencies. So we should also use it with TravisCI!

And as TravisCI has the needed `virtualenv` already installed per default in it's `python` machines, we only need to do (and replace the `pip install XYZ` commands):

```yaml
  # Install pipenv dependency manager
  - pip install pipenv
  # Install required (and locked) dependecies from Pipfile.lock. pipenv is smart enough to recognise the existing 
  # virtualenv without a prior pipenv shell command (see https://medium.com/@dirk.avery/quirks-of-pipenv-on-travis-ci-and-appveyor-10d6adb6c55b)
  - pipenv install
```

  - pipenv install
```



## Use CircleCI to execute Molecule with EC2 infrastructure

As TravisCI is just one example of a cloud CI provider, let's use another one also - so let's just pick [CircleCI](https://circleci.com), let's go with this CI tool!  

> Using Molecule to develop and test an Ansible role - togehter with the infrastructure provider AWS EC2 - automatically executed by CircleCI after commits or regularly with CircleCI scheduled jobs.



So let's do it! First we need to configure CircleCI. Therefore we need to create a [.circleci/config.yml](.circleci/config.yml). As we need the same python package additions as locally, we need to install `boto`, `boto3` and `awscli`:

```yaml
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/python:3.7.5

    environment:
      EC2_REGION: eu-central-1

    working_directory: ~/molecule-ansible-docker-vagrant

    steps:
      - checkout

      - run:
          name: Install Molecule dependencies
          command: |
            pip install molecule docker

      - run:
          name: Run Molecule Testing CircleCI-locally with Docker
          command: |
            molecule test

      - run:
          name: Install Molecule AWS dependencies
          command: |
            pip install boto boto3
            pip install --upgrade awscli

      - run:
          name: configure AWS CLI
          command: |
            aws configure set aws_access_key_id ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY}
            aws configure set aws_secret_access_key ${AWS_SECRET_KEY}
            aws configure set default.region ${EC2_REGION}
            aws configure list

      - run:
          name: Run Molecule Testing on AWS EC2
          command: |
            molecule create --scenario-name aws-ec2-ubuntu
            molecule converge --scenario-name aws-ec2-ubuntu
            molecule verify --scenario-name aws-ec2-ubuntu
            molecule destroy --scenario-name aws-ec2-ubuntu

```

After that, we need to configure our AWS CLI to use the correct credentials and AWS region. This can be achieved by usind the `aws configure set` command. Then we need to head over to the settings tab of our CircleCI project (for the current project this can be found at https://circleci.com/gh/jonashackt/molecule-ansible-docker-vagrant/edit#env-vars) and insert the three environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` & `AWS_SECRET_KEY`:

![circleci-aws-settings-env-variables](screenshots/circleci-aws-settings-env-variables.png)

The last part is to add the molecule commands to our `.circleci/config.yml`. 

### CircleCI gives Permission denied error at pip install

Using `circleci/python` Docker image it seems that you can't simply use `pip install xyz`:

```
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ptyprocess'
```

This error is also [reported here](https://discuss.circleci.com/t/circleci-python-docker-images-disallow-pip-install-due-to-directory-ownership/12504). To avoid this error, we need to use `sudo` to be able to install the pip packages successfully:

```yaml
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/python:3.7.5
...
    steps:
      - checkout

      - run:
          name: Install Molecule dependencies
          command: |
            sudo pip install molecule docker

      - run:
          name: Run Molecule Testing CircleCI-locally with Docker
          command: |
            molecule test
```

### "msg": "Error connecting: Error while fetching server API version: ('Connection aborted.', FileNotFoundError(2, 'No such file or directory'))"

Molecule needs a Docker service available. Since CircleCI is mostly using pure Docker-based images to run it's CI jobs, there's no Docker service inside the Docker containers available. But there's help! [The docs state](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/building-docker-images/):

> If your job requires docker or docker-compose commands, add the setup_remote_docker step into your .circleci/config.yml

We need to use `- setup_remote_docker`

```yaml
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/python:3.7.5
...
    steps:
      - checkout  
      - setup_remote_docker 
```

> Don't use `docker_layer_caching: true`, if you only have the free tier available (see https://github.com/jonashackt/molecule-ansible-docker-vagrant/issues/5)!!

Now head over to CircleCI and have a look into the log. It should look green and somehow like this: https://circleci.com/gh/jonashackt/molecule-ansible-docker-vagrant/16 :

![circleci-aws-full-run-docker-aws](screenshots/circleci-aws-full-run-docker-aws.png)


### Use pipenv with CircleCI

As we already use `pipenv` with our local project setup and with TravisCI, CircleCI builds should also depend on this great dependency-lock supporting Python build tool.

And [in the examples](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/language-python/#install-dependencies) there's already the part we need instead of `pip install XYZ` commands:

```yaml
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/python:3.7.5

    environment:
      EC2_REGION: eu-central-1

    working_directory: ~/molecule-ansible-docker-vagrant

    steps:
      - checkout
      - setup_remote_docker

      - run:
          name: Install all dependencies with pipenv (incl. python-dev installation for pip packages, that need to be build & have a Python.h present)
          command: |
            sudo apt-get install python-dev
            sudo pip install pipenv
            pipenv shell
            pipenv install
```

This gets us (maybe) into the following error:

```
An error occurred while installing psutil==5.6.5 ; sys_platform != 'win32' and sys_platform != 'cygwin'
...
'    psutil/_psutil_common.c:9:10: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory', '     #include <Python.h>', '              ^~~~~~~~~~', '    compilation terminated.', "    error: command 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit status 1", '    ----------------------------------------', 'ERROR: Command errored out with exit status 1: /home/circleci/.local/share/virtualenvs/molecule-ansible-docker-vagrant-082rgMyr/bin/python3.7 -u -c \'import sys, setuptools, tokenize; sys.argv[0] = \'"\'"\'/tmp/pip-install-fecrj6wj/psutil/setup.py\'"\'"\'; __file__=\'"\'"\'/tmp/pip-install-fecrj6wj/psutil/setup.py\'"\'"\';f=getattr(tokenize, \'"\'"\'open\'"\'"\', open)(__file__);code=f.read().replace(\'"\'"\'\\r\\n\'"\'"\', \'"\'"\'\\n\'"\'"\');f.close();exec(compile(code, __file__, \'"\'"\'exec\'"\'"\'))\' install --record /tmp/pip-record-iium4npj/install-record.txt --single-version-externally-managed --compile --install-headers /home/circleci/.local/share/virtualenvs/molecule-ansible-docker-vagrant-082rgMyr/include/site/python3.7/psutil Check the logs for full command output.']
```

This seems to be [a knows issue](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/issues/1143#issuecomment-334694641), if `python-dev` package isn't available, no PIP packages could be build locally.

So let's add a `sudo apt-get install python-dev` to our [.circleci/config.yml](.circleci/config.yml).


Now using pipenv, we can't simply activate the `pipenv` shell with a `pipenv shell` -> this will stop our CircleCI builds right in the middle ([see this build](https://circleci.com/gh/jonashackt/molecule-ansible-docker-vagrant/84))
 
The docs don't mention that one clearly enough - __BUT__ otherwise the commands like `molecule` etc wont be able to find, [see this build](https://circleci.com/gh/jonashackt/molecule-ansible-docker-vagrant/81)!

The solution is to run every command with a prefixed `pipenv run` - like `pipenv run molecule test`. 



### Schedule regular CircleCI builds with workflow triggers & cron

As the docs at https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/triggers/#scheduled-builds state, we need to add the `workflows` section inside our [.circleci/config.yml](.circleci/config.yml) to be able to use cron-scheduled builds. First we introduce a `on-commit:` workflow, which will just be triggered by a normal git commit/push. Nothing new here.

But the second workflow item `weekly-schedule:` gets us where we wanted to be: using the `cron` trigger we can configure to run our Molecule tests e.g. once on friday 04:45 PM every week:

```yaml
workflows:
  version: 2
  on-commit:
    jobs:
      - build
  weekly-schedule:
    triggers:
      - schedule:
          # 17:55 every friday (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron)
          cron: "55 17 * * 5"
          filters:
            branches:
              only:
                - master
    jobs:
      - build
```

Now we should see our builds triggered by this cron regularly:

![circleci-cron-weekly-schedule](screenshots/circleci-cron-weekly-schedule.png)

Just mind the `UTC+2` timezone - for me, configuring `17:55` actually means, that my job will be scheduled to run at `19:55` - so don't think your config is wrong, maybe you're just in another timezone :)


## Upgrade to Molecule v3

With Molecule 3.x our project and especially the `molecule.yml` needs some refinement. [Here's an good overview](https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule/issues/2560).

Especially the `lint` sections and the `scenario-name` has to go - the latter is derived from the directory name and is thus not doubled anymore. The linting is now configured separately ([see this commit](https://github.com/jonashackt/molecule-ansible-docker-aws/commit/74b0ad7ac011e27bacfcf2e3d5d8ada257d393cb)). 

Additionally now only `Docker`, `Podman` and `Delegated` are supposed to be core-providers. All other providers are now regarded as community-supported providers. For us as Molecule users this means, we need to install separate dependencies - since these providers now also have their own GitHub repo (see https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule-vagrant for example).

To use Vagrant, we need to add a new dependency to our [Pipfile](Pipfile):

```
molecule-vagrant = "==0.2"
testinfra = "==4.1.0"
```

As we Testinfra is now also not longer installed by default, we should also add it explicitely. 


## Use Vagrant on TravisCI to execute Molecule

Well that one was on my list for a long time (and I guess not only on my list, [Ansible famous geerlingguy couldn't believe his ears also](https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule-vagrant/issues/8#issuecomment-589795115)), but it is now possible to __run a full-blown Vagrant Box on TravisCI__. I had to create a example project for that, see it in action if you like: https://github.com/jonashackt/vagrant-travisci-libvrt

So now we should be able to do this with Molecule too, right?!

Therefore, let's have a look into our [.travis.yml](.travis.yml), where we only run our Docker-in-Docker tests right now. Because we need to install and configure Vagrant there also:

```yaml
...

# Cache the big Vagrant boxes
cache:
  directories:
    - /home/travis/.vagrant.d/boxes
    - /home/travis/.cache/pipenv

install:
  ### Vagrant installation
  # Install libvrt & KVM (see https://github.com/alvistack/ansible-role-virtualbox/blob/master/.travis.yml)
  - sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y bridge-utils dnsmasq-base ebtables libvirt-bin libvirt-dev qemu-kvm qemu-utils ruby-dev

  # Download Vagrant & Install Vagrant package
  - sudo wget -nv https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.2.7/vagrant_2.2.7_x86_64.deb
  - sudo dpkg -i vagrant_2.2.7_x86_64.deb
  - sudo vagrant --version

  # Install vagrant-libvirt Vagrant plugin
  - sudo vagrant plugin install vagrant-libvirt
  - sudo vagrant plugin list
...
```

The installation of Vagrant & libvirt/KVM is exactly the same as in the https://github.com/jonashackt/vagrant-travisci-libvrt

We also need to execute Vagrant with `sudo`, otherwise we'll run into the [known permission denied errors](https://github.com/jonashackt/vagrant-travisci-libvrt#prevent-errors-like-the-home-directory-you-specified-is-not-accessible).


## Install Python 3 for sudo access & pipenv based on Python 3

If you try to go the fast path and use a Travis Python build image (as described in the docs: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/python/), you'll run into a dead end!

Because if we use the Python image (even in 3.x!)

```yaml
dist: bionic
language: python
# configure python version (see https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/python/#specifying-python-versions)
python:
  - "3.7"
``` 

we will not get a Python 3 based `pip` to install our `pipenv` on, if we use `sudo pip install`! This is [because Python 3 is only installed as a separate virtualenv for each version](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/python/#travis-ci-uses-isolated-virtualenvs).

But as our Molecule project's dependencies need Python 3.4 as a minimum, we'll [run into errors like](https://travis-ci.org/github/jonashackt/molecule-ansible-docker-aws/builds/661102534):

```

    '.'.join(map(str, sys.version_info[:3])),)
pipenv.patched.notpip._internal.exceptions.UnsupportedPythonVersion: testinfra requires Python '>=3.4' but the running Python is 2.7.17
```

Also trying to use Python 3 explicitely with the command `sudo pip3 install` will result in error (whereas `pip3 install` without the `sudo` works perfectly fine):

```
$ sudo pip3 install pipenv
sudo: pip3: command not found
```

So we need to install Python 3 for sudo access also. Let's do this inside the [.travis.yml](.travis.yml) `install:` section. As we use the `dist: bionic` which is Ubuntu Bionic 18.04, [we already have a Python 3.x installation build in](https://askubuntu.com/a/865569/451114) we can simply upgrade:

```yaml
  # Install Python 3 for usage together with sudo into our Travis build image
  - sudo apt-get install python3.8
  - curl -skL https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | sudo -H python3.8
```

With this we should be able to use Python 3.x together with `sudo pip`, which we directly use to install `pipenv`:

```yaml
  # Install required (and locked) dependecies with pipenv
  - sudo -H pip install pipenv
  - sudo -H pipenv install
```

I also experienced `pipenv` not running inside my job, but instead given the following error message:

```
The directory '/home/travis/.cache/pipenv/http' or its parent directory is not owned by the current user and the cache has been disabled. Please check the permissions and owner of that directory. If executing pip with sudo, you may want sudo's -H flag.
The directory '/home/travis/.cache/pipenv' or its parent directory is not owned by the current user and caching wheels has been disabled. check the permissions and owner of that directory. If executing pip with sudo, you may want sudo's -H flag.
Ignoring ruamel.yaml: markers 'python_version >= "3.7"' don't match your environment
``` 

So we need to install `pipenv` via `pip` using the `sudo -H` option - the same applies to the `pipenv install` command.



### Using VirtualBox locally furthermore - but switching to libvirt on TravisCI

VirtualBox is [one of the three default Vagrant providers](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/providers/) (+ Hyper-V & Docker) - and it is widely used in projects and blog posts. Additionally many folks use MacOS on their development machines, so I don't want to switch the virtualization provider for my Molecule tests locally.

Since TravisCI only supports the `libvirt/KVM` provider (see the not-working https://github.com/jonashackt/vagrant-travisci), we __need to use libvirt/KVM with TravisCI__.

As we already have a VirtualBox based Molecule scenario [vagrant-ubuntu](molecule/vagrant-ubuntu), wouldn't it be great to be able to use this scenario with VirtualBox locally - and with libvirt/KVM on TravisCI?!

There is the option of configuring Molecule directly in the [molecule.yml](molecule/vagrant-ubuntu/molecule.yml) file with:

```yaml
...
driver:
  name: vagrant
  provider:
    name: libvirt
...
```

But in this case, we wouldn't be able to use VirtualBox as our local provider. We also can't simply tell Vagrant to use the provider `libvirt` with `vagrant up --provider=libvirt`, since we're using Molecule which itself controls Vagrant.

So we need another method to tell Vagrant to run with `libvirt` only on TravisCI.

Luckily there's another option described in the [vagrant-libvirt Plugin docs](https://github.com/vagrant-libvirt/vagrant-libvirt#start-vm), where we could use an environment variable `VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=libvirt`. So let's enhance our [.travis.yml](.travis.yml):

```yaml
env:
- VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=libvirt

```

### Run our Molecule Vagrant Scenario

Since we need to use `sudo` for executing Vagrant without errors, we also sticked to it while installing our Python dependencies with `pipenv`.

To have those deps available, we also need to execute Molecule using `sudo`. Using `sudo pipenv run molecule` should do the trick, right?

__NO!__ That's not enough. I really gave away lot's and lot's of hours debugging this! You'll run into errors like the following:

```
$ sudo cat /root/.cache/molecule/docker/vagrant-libvirt-ubuntu/vagrant-vagrant-libvirt-ubuntu.err
### 2020-03-11 12:23:54 ###
### 2020-03-11 12:23:54 ###
The provider 'libvirt' could not be found, but was requested to
back the machine 'vagrant-libvirt-ubuntu'. Please use a provider that exists.
Vagrant knows about the following providers: hyperv, docker, virtualbox
```

So even using `sudo` doesn't solve the problem here! We need to consider the `sudo -E` switch. This will preserve the user environment when running the commands. Therefore successfully spinning up a Vagrant environment with Molecule on TravisCI only works with `sudo -E pipenv run molecule create --scenario-name vagrant-ubuntu`. You can see Travis' full `script` section here:

```yaml
script:
  # Molecule Testing Travis-locally with Vagrant
  - sudo -E pipenv run molecule create --scenario-name vagrant-ubuntu
  - sudo -E pipenv run molecule converge --scenario-name vagrant-ubuntu
  - sudo -E pipenv run molecule verify --scenario-name vagrant-ubuntu
  - sudo -E pipenv run molecule destroy --scenario-name vagrant-ubuntu
```
